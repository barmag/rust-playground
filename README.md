Shadowing allows the reuse of variables with the same name. The shadowed variable can change the data type or mutability. The shadow variable can be limited to a specific scope, and the original variable is restored after getting out of the scope. Shadowing can be used to reuse common names, but if not used with intent can lead to wierd bugs.
